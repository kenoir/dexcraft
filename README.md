## Welcome

Welcome to Dexter's Minecraft server!

To get access you will need to give Dexter your Minecraft username to be added to the server.

### Times to play

The server is online between:
- 3:15pm - 6:30pm GMT weekdays.
- 9:30am to 6:30pm Saturday and Sunday.

At other times the server will automatically switch itself off!

## Installing Minecraft

You will need the java version of Minecraft at version 1.12.2.

We recommend using [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/downloads).

Once you have installed ATLauncher you will need to install the correct Minecraft version.

## Using the Server

The server is accessible at [server.dexcraft.net](server.dexcraft.net).

When you start Minecraft, click "Multiplayer", "Add Server" and use these details:

You will need to be whitelisted in order to access the server, so _just ask Dexter_.

## Troubleshooting

Ask Robert.
